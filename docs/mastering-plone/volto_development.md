## Editor

The variety of editors is big.
Try `VSCode` if you do not already use it and don't have a strong alternative preference.
`VSCode` comes with a good support for programming React apps and development in general.

`VSCode` extensions:

- "Add jsdoc comments" 
  
  Adds simple jsdoc comments for the parameters of a selected function signature.
- "Better Comments"
  
  Improve your code commenting by annotating with alert, informational, TODOs, â€¦
- "Babel JavaScript"
  
  Syntax highlighting for Javascript and React
- "Easy Snippet"
  
  Turn your selection into a snippet.

### Postman

Postman is an app that lets you execute and save requests.
We will request REST API endpoints of the backend later with actions.

## Tips

A variables value can of course always printed to the developer tools console with `console.debug("var_name", var_name)`.
But if you want to see values inside rendered components and the value is an Object, than this is also possible.
Just include `{JSON.stringify(var_name_object)}` in your components `html` code.
