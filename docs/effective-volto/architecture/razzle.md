# Razzle

Razzle is an easy boilerplate generator for isomorphic JavaScript applications.
Isomorphic applications can run the same code on the client (browsers) and in the server.
Volto is based on [Razzle](https://razzlejs.org), which acts as a really advanced Webpack configuration.

Razzle is extensible and Volto is built upon that extensible framework.
It allows to extend the Webpack configuration both from the core (vanilla Volto), a project and even a Volto addon.
It also allows to tap into the most important development artifacts and extend them (ESLint config, etc).
It defines the Babel configuration baseline, and allows you to extend it as well.
It has all the modern development tools (HMR, etc) and a plugin system that you can use from your projects.
