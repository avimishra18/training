# Migrate to Volto

See the chapter {ref}`plone6docs:backend-migrate-to-volto-label` of the Plone Upgrade Guide.

Issues:

* Complex HTML, such as in tables, is transformed to HTML blocks.
* There is no migration from DraftJS to Slate.

Alternatives:

* Start fresh
* Use `collective.exportimport` (TODO: https://github.com/collective/collective.exportimport/issues/133).
